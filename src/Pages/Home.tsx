                    NetNotes is a dedicated knowledge base for networking topics, with a focus on Cisco technologies and certifications. It was created to help refresh my knowledge after earning past CCNA certifications in Routing & Switching and Network Security (210-060 and 210-260), which expired in 2022 following Ciscoâ€™s certification changes.

                <p className='siteInfoContent'>
                    The site covers core networking concepts, layered models, tools like Wireshark and GNS3, and exam preparation material for CCNA and CCNP paths. It is continuously updated as I review foundational topics, explore new developments in the field, and prepare to potentially recertify.
