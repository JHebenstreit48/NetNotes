# Evolution of Ethernet Speeds

## Original Ethernet (10 Mbps)
- Introduced in the **1970s** and formalized in **1983** under the IEEE 802.3 standard.
- **Mbps** stands for **Megabits per second**, where:
  - **Mega** = 1 million.
  - **Bit** = the smallest unit of data in computing.
- **10 Mbps** means the network can transfer **10 million bits per second**.

## Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps)
- Introduced in **1995** under the IEEE 802.3u standard.
- **100 Mbps** = 10 times the speed of the original Ethernet.

## Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps or 1 Gbps)
- Introduced in **1999** under the IEEE 802.3ab standard.
- **Gbps** stands for **Gigabits per second**, where:
  - **Giga** = 1 billion.
  - **Bit** = the smallest unit of data in computing.
- **1 Gbps** means the network can transfer **1 billion bits per second**.

## 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10,000 Mbps or 10 Gbps)
- Standardized in **2002** as IEEE 802.3ae.
- **10 Gbps** = **10 billion bits per second**.
- Primarily used in data centers and enterprise networks.

## 40 Gigabit and 100 Gigabit Ethernet
- Standardized in **2010** under IEEE 802.3ba.
- **40 Gbps** = **40 billion bits per second**.
- **100 Gbps** = **100 billion bits per second**.
- Used in large-scale enterprise and cloud data centers.

## Beyond 100 Gigabit Ethernet
- Standards for **200 Gbps** and **400 Gbps** introduced in **2017** (IEEE 802.3bs).
- Research is ongoing into **800 Gbps** and **1.6 Tbps** for future networking needs.
