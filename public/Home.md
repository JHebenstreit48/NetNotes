  NetNotes is a personal knowledge base for <span class="emphasis">IT networking</span>, with an
  emphasis on Cisco technologies and certification paths like CCNA and CCNP. It was built to help
  consolidate and refresh everything I've learned from past certifications in Routing & Switching and
  Network Security, and it continues to evolve as I revisit foundational concepts, explore advanced
  topics, and expand into areas like VoIP, wireless, and modern network security practices.

<div class="Note">
  NOTE: All four projects—NetNotes, DevScriptStax, AppFoundry, and PixelProse—are currently undergoing
  a major refactor of navigation and routes. The primary focus is on granularizing categories and
  subpages, restructuring content for consistency, and implementing lazy-loaded routing across the
  sites.  

  While this structural work is the main priority, new notes and topic pages are also being added in
  parallel, though content expansion is not the central focus at this stage. Use the navigation above
  to explore notes on switching, routing, TCP/IP and OSI models, ACLs, device configuration, tools
  like GNS3 and Wireshark, and more.
