  NetNotes is a personal knowledge base for <span class="emphasis">IT networking</span>, with an emphasis on Cisco technologies and certification paths like CCNA and CCNP. It was built to help consolidate and refresh everything I've learned from past certifications in Routing & Switching and Network Security, and it continues to evolve as I revisit foundational concepts, explore advanced topics, and expand into areas like VoIP, wireless, and modern network security practices.
