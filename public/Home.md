<div class="siteInfoContent">
  NetNotes is a personal knowledge base for IT networking, with an emphasis on Cisco technologies
  and certification paths like CCNA and CCNP. It was built to help consolidate and refresh
  everything I've learned from past certifications in Routing & Switching and Network Security, and
  it continues to evolve as I revisit foundational concepts and explore advanced topics.

<div class="Note">
  NOTE: Each project is focused on organizing technical knowledge across different domains. All of
  them are being actively maintained, but current efforts are focused on refactoring routing,
  navigation, and lazy-loaded pages for NetNotes and DevScriptStax.

Also, many pages and features may still be in progress as this site is continually refined. Use
the navigation above to explore notes on switching, routing, TCP/IP and OSI models, ACLs, device
configuration, tools like GNS3 and Wireshark, and more.
